# Project Proposal

### Project title

NYU Pick-up Basketball

### What and why?

I would like to build a platform for people to be able to sign up for pickup basketball games at one of NYU's indoor gyms. This platform would solve the problem of people showing up at random times and not having enough people to play full games with. It would also make the games more organized.

### For whom?

This software will be for NYU students and community members with access to the gyms. Specifically it is for those who have an interest in sports.

### How?

The system will display the schedule of the basketball courts (or whichever sport is chosen) and will allow users to sign up for a time slot so that other users know when there will be players at the court. Other users can then do the same.

### Scope

I think the project is the right level of difficulty because it has multiple challenges including figuring out how to pull the data about court availability each day, storing it and user information/sign ups, and also displaying all the information in an interface that is clean and pleasant to look at. I believe this is possible for a team of programmers to accomplish over the course of a semester as long as they remain organized.
